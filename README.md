# Rangen
Rangen is a generator of random int and string written in Python.   
I used the least possible libraries, so you could use it in embedded area or an OS written in python like [PythonOS](https://github.com/Abb1x/pythonOS) compiled with a compiler like [snek](https://github.com/Abb1x/snek).  
(I used sys for the cli, but you could just remove the cli part with a patch file and I used the numpy library to create an array of zero, but I am reimplementing it)



## Installation
To install rangen,you need pip.
You need to launch this command : 
```
pip install rangen
```
